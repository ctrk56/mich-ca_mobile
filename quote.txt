MichCA: Is a non-profit organization establised in 2001. 

1> We are thinking of a basic update(MVP) to the site http://mich-ca.org. 
2> Easily maintainable like just using JS jQuery html pages
2a> Layout and structre can be the same. Just need a face lift to the website.
3> Except Tournaments and Points section rest of the content will be static.
4> We are planning to buy data feed (APIs) from cricHQ and would like incorporate that.
5> The data feed will be for Tournaments and Points (this is where it will be tricky) but again as simple as possible.
6> Need two new pages i.e., Dashboard page which is ajax and will have widgets/sections and should use data feeds.
6a> The second page will be a photo gallery and should be self organized like just dump photos in a location and
the page should be able to just show paginated view of latest photos.
to show information like news, upcoming matchs, leader boards etc..
7> MichCA will be hosting the site.
8> I'm can make sure MichCA will come to you for any future maintanance and changes.
